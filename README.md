# qlab-cue-viewer-web

Static web viewer. Subscribes to `relay-server` and renders the current QLab cue full-screen — designed to be opened on a phone, monitor, or projector anywhere with internet.

## Dev

```sh
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # point at your relay
npm run dev
```

## Configure at runtime

You can override relay settings via URL params so a single deploy can serve multiple shows:

```
https://viewer.example.com/?relay=wss://relay.your-domain.tld&token=…&channel=qlab-show-1
```

## Build & deploy

```sh
npm run build   # → dist/
```

Static output — drop into Cloudflare Pages / Netlify / Vercel / any static host.
